Following are the instructions to set up the an environment to run the following generators, QPythia, Jewel, Pyquen, PyquenWide and PythiaZ2*. This is done using slightly modified code from https://github.com/yenjie/HIGenerator by Yen-Jie Lee. There three methods to set this which are detailed below.  Options 1 and 2 leave you with python config files which are slightly differnet than Yen-Jie's in that they allow for the command line arguments output='?' and maxEvents=? with cmsRun.

Methods to set up - presented in order of increasing difficultly:  
  
1.  
Advantage: easiet set up will get you runnign monte carlo generators and plotting analysis quickest.  
Disadvantage: Does not set up a git repo to which you can push code  

note: You can also fork ianhi/GeneratorInterface.git and ianhi/MonteMacros.git if you would like to be able to push updates to your own github account  
  
2.   
Advantages:   
	Only one repository  
	Allows you to push code to your own git repository   
Disadvantage:  
	More steps than option 1  
	Requires greater knowledge of git	  
   

3. Documentation of how I set up the files for the above two options. This shouldn't be necessary.  
  
  

1. ==============================================================================
cmsrel CMSSW_5_3_20  
cd CMSSW_5_3_20/src/  
cmsenv  
git clone git@github.com:ianhi/GeneratorInterace.git  
git clone git@github.com:ianhi/MonteMacros.git  
scram b -j20  
cd GeneratorInterface/QPythiaInterface/test/  
wget http://www-fp.usc.es/nestor/PbPb2760_00-05.dat.gz  
gunzip PbPb2760_00-05.dat.gz  
  



2. ===============================================================================
# First fork the official cmssw repo to your github account https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw  
  
# Now in new area on your lxplus:  
# NOTE: this will not work if there is anything in the src/ directory
  
cmsrel CMSSW_5_3_20    
cd CMSSW_5_3_20/src/   
cmsenv    
git cms-merge-topic -u ianhi:HIGenerator  
  
#now set up your own branch so you can modify the code  
  
git remote add <remote_name> git@github.com:<your_username>/cmssw.git  #remote name can be whatever you like. You use it to tell git where to pull from  
git fetch <remote_name>  
git checkout -b <name_of_your_branch>  
  
cd GeneratorInterface/QPythiaInterface/test/  
wget http://www-fp.usc.es/nestor/PbPb2760_00-05.dat.gz  
gunzip PbPb2760_00-05.dat.gz  
  
cd ../../..  
scram b -j20  
  
#plotting macros  
git clone git@github.com:ianhi/MonteMacros.git  
  
#you should now be able to run the generators using cmsRun test<Generator>.py these files are located in the test/ directory of the generator interfaces  
#e.g. cmsRun testPyquen.py output='OUTNAME.root' maxEvents=300  
  
3. =============================================================================== 
    
How to assemble this from YenJie's Github: https://github.com/yenjie/HIGenerator  
   
cmsrel CMSSW_5_3_20/ 
cd CMSSW_5_3_20/src/  
cmsenv  

#optional setting up branch - you must have forked cmssw for this - part 1  
	git cms-init  
	git checkout CMSSW_5_3_20  
	git remote add <remote_name> git@github.com:<your_github_name>/cmssw.git  
	git checkout -b <name_of_your_branch>  
	emacs -nw .gitignore  
	#add the following:  
		*.root  
		PbPb2760_00-05.dat  
	#Save and exit file  
#End of part 1 of optional fork  
  
git clone git@github.com:yenjie/HIGenerator.git  
mkdir GeneratorInterface  
mv HIGenerator/cmssw/* GeneratorInterface/  
rm GeneratorInterface/QPythiaInterface/test/input  
mv HIGenerator/q-pythia/input GeneratorInterface/QPythiaInterface/test/.  
rm HIGenerator -rf  
cd GeneratorInterface/  
rm -rf README.md python YajemInterface  
cd JewelInterface/test/  
rm testJewel.py  
cd ../QPythiaInterface/test  
wget http://www-fp.usc.es/nestor/PbPb2760_00-05.dat.gz  
gunzip PbPb2760_00-05.dat.gz  
rm output  
ln -s ../test/ output #or whereever you would like your output to go to  

#OPTIONAL FORKING - part 2  
git add .  
git commit -m "first commit"  
git push <remote_name> <name_of_your_branch>  
#end part 2 of optional  
  
scram b -j20  
  
  
#Plotting and analysis macros in MonteMacros were derived from the plot macros in https://github.com/yenjie/HIGenerator/genAna/macros/
